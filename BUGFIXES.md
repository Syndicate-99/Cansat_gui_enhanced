# 🐛 Bug Fixes - CanSat GUI Enhanced

## Version 1.1 - Bug Fix Release

### Fixed Issues

#### ✅ Bug #1: Stop Mission Button Doesn't Stop Timer
**Problem:** Clicking "Stop Mission" didn't stop the mission timer display  
**Fix:** Now properly resets `mission_start_time` to `None` when stopping  
**Impact:** Timer now stops correctly when mission ends

---

#### ✅ Bug #2: Incorrect Speed Calculation
**Problem:** Speed was using acceleration data (data[8]) instead of actual velocity  
**Fix:** Now calculates speed from simulator's velocity or altitude changes  
**Impact:** Speed graph now shows realistic velocity values (0-8 m/s)

---

#### ✅ Bug #3: Random Data When Mission Not Started
**Problem:** Statistics updated even when mission wasn't started  
**Fix:** Added check to only update stats when `mission_start_time` is set  
**Impact:** Cleaner display, stats only update during active mission

---

#### ✅ Bug #4: Alert Spam
**Problem:** Alerts triggered continuously for same event  
**Fix:** Added `last_alert_altitude` tracking to trigger alerts only once  
**Impact:** Alerts panel no longer floods with repeated messages

---

#### ✅ Bug #5: Mission Stats Show Random Values Initially
**Problem:** LCD displays showed undefined values before mission start  
**Fix:** Reset function now explicitly sets all displays to 0.00  
**Impact:** Clean startup with all zeros until mission begins

---

#### ✅ Bug #6: Flight Time Counter Issues
**Problem:** Flight time used separate timer instead of mission timer  
**Fix:** Removed redundant flight_start_time, now uses mission_start_time  
**Impact:** Flight time now syncs with mission timer

---

#### ✅ Bug #7: Alerts Trigger Before Mission Start
**Problem:** Altitude alerts triggered even when not recording  
**Fix:** Added mission_start_time check before calling check_alerts()  
**Impact:** Alerts only appear during active mission

---

#### ✅ Bug #8: Alert State Not Reset Between Missions
**Problem:** Starting new mission didn't reset alert tracking  
**Fix:** Reset `last_alert_altitude` in start_mission() and stop_mission()  
**Impact:** Each mission has fresh alert tracking

---

## What's Fixed

### Before:
```
❌ Stop button clicked → Timer keeps running
❌ Speed shows 0-10 (acceleration values)
❌ Stats update even when not recording
❌ Alert: "Approaching max altitude!" x100 times
❌ LCD displays show "-------" initially
❌ Flight time doesn't match mission time
❌ Alerts spam before mission starts
```

### After:
```
✅ Stop button clicked → Timer stops immediately
✅ Speed shows realistic 0-8 m/s values
✅ Stats only update during active mission
✅ Alert: "Approaching max altitude!" (once)
✅ LCD displays show "0.00" initially
✅ Flight time syncs with mission timer
✅ Alerts only during mission recording
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Timer Stop
```
1. Start GUI: python test_cansat_gui.py
2. Click "Start Mission"
3. Wait 10 seconds (timer should show ~10.00)
4. Click "Stop Mission"
5. ✅ Timer should STOP (not keep counting)
```

### Test 2: Speed Values
```
1. Start GUI
2. Click "Start Mission"
3. Watch Speed graph during ascent
4. ✅ Speed should show 0 → 8 m/s (not random 0-10)
```

### Test 3: Stats Behavior
```
1. Start GUI
2. DON'T click "Start Mission"
3. Watch for 30 seconds
4. ✅ Max altitude should stay at 0.00
5. Click "Start Mission"
6. ✅ Now stats should update
```

### Test 4: Alert Spam
```
1. Start GUI
2. Click "Start Mission"
3. Wait until altitude > 900m (~60 seconds)
4. ✅ Should see ONE "Approaching max altitude" alert
5. ✅ Not 50+ repeated alerts
```

### Test 5: Clean Startup
```
1. Start GUI
2. Check Mission Stats panel
3. ✅ All LCD displays should show "0.00"
4. ✅ Not "-------" or random numbers
```

## Known Remaining Issues (Minor)

### Issue 1: Phase Indicator During Stop
- Phase indicator continues showing current phase after stop
- Not critical, can be fixed by uncommenting line in stop_mission()
- Workaround: Visual indicator that phase detection continues

### Issue 2: Data Quality Updates
- Data quality panel updates even when mission not started
- Not critical, shows continuous telemetry reception
- Considered a feature (can see connection before starting)

## Technical Details

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Timer Management**
   ```python
   def stop_mission(self):
       self.mission_start_time = None  # ← Added this
       # ... rest of code
   ```

2. **Speed Calculation**
   ```python
   # OLD: self.speeds[-1] = data[8]  # Wrong!
   # NEW:
   if hasattr(self.ser, 'simulator'):
       actual_speed = self.ser.simulator.get_speed()
   ```

3. **Alert Tracking**
   ```python
   # Added state tracking
   self.last_alert_altitude = None
   
   # Only trigger alert once
   if altitude > 900 and (self.last_alert_altitude is None or ...):
   ```

4. **Conditional Updates**
   ```python
   # OLD: Always update
   self.mission_stats.update_stats(...)
   
   # NEW: Only when mission active
   if self.mission_start_time:
       self.mission_stats.update_stats(...)
   ```
