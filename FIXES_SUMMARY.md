# 🔧 BUGS FIXED - Quick Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Stop Mission Button Now Works!
**Before:** Timer kept running after clicking "Stop Mission"  
**After:** Timer stops immediately when you click "Stop Mission"

---

### 2. ✅ Speed Graph Fixed!
**Before:** Speed showed random 0-10 values (was using acceleration data)  
**After:** Speed shows realistic 0-8 m/s during flight

---

### 3. ✅ No More Alert Spam!
**Before:** "Approaching max altitude!" appeared 100+ times  
**After:** Each alert appears only ONCE

---

### 4. ✅ Clean Startup Display!
**Before:** LCD displays showed "-------" or random numbers  
**After:** Everything shows "0.00" until mission starts

---

### 5. ✅ Stats Only Update When Recording!
**Before:** Max altitude/speed updated even when mission not started  
**After:** Stats only update during active mission (after clicking "Start Mission")

---

### 6. ✅ Mission Timer Synced!
**Before:** Flight time counter had its own timer  
**After:** Flight time uses same timer as mission timer (synced perfectly)

---

### 7. ✅ Alerts Only During Mission!
**Before:** Alerts triggered even before starting mission  
**After:** Alerts only appear after clicking "Start Mission"

---

### 8. ✅ Fresh Start for Each Mission!
**Before:** Starting new mission kept old alert states  
**After:** Each mission starts with clean alert tracking

---

## How to Test the Fixes

```bash
# Quick 2-minute test
python test_cansat_gui.py

1. Click "Start Mission" ← Timer starts counting
2. Watch for 1 minute ← See ONE alert at high altitude
3. Click "Stop Mission" ← Timer STOPS (not keeps running!)
4. Check speed graph ← Shows 0-8 m/s (not 0-10)
```

## Before vs After

```
BEFORE (Buggy):
❌ Stop → Timer keeps going
❌ Speed: 0, 5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3... (random)
❌ Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert... (spam)
❌ Stats: "147.32" before mission even starts
❌ LCD: "-------" (undefined)

AFTER (Fixed):
✅ Stop → Timer stops immediately
✅ Speed: 0 → 8 m/s → 5 m/s (realistic)
✅ Alert once at high altitude
✅ Stats: "0.00" until mission starts
✅ LCD: "0.00" (clean display)
```
