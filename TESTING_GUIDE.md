# üß™ CanSat GUI Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### Method 1: Automatic Flight Simulation (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the test launcher
python test_cansat_gui.py
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Launch the GUI with simulated flight data
- ‚úÖ Simulate a complete 250-second flight (runs at 2x speed)
- ‚úÖ Show realistic telemetry from pre-launch to landing
- ‚úÖ Automatically trigger phase changes and alerts

### Method 2: Manual Testing with Random Data

The GUI already includes fallback dummy data if the communication module isn't available.

```bash
# Just run the enhanced GUI directly
python cansat_gui_enhanced.py
```

### Test Scenario 1: Normal Flight
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Goal:** Verify all phases work correctly

1. Start the GUI
2. Go to Real-Time tab
3. Click "Start Mission"
4. Watch the simulation for 5 minutes
5. Verify phase transitions
6. Click "Export Data"
7. Go to Analysis tab and load the data

**Success Criteria:**

2. "Approaching maximum altitude!" (WARNING - yellow) at ~900m
3. "Low altitude - Landing phase" (INFO - green) at <100m

**Manual Alert Test:**
You can add this code to trigger custom alerts:
```python
self.alerts_panel.add_alert("Test Warning", "WARNING")
self.alerts_panel.add_alert("Test Critical", "CRITICAL")
```

---

### Test Scenario 3: Data Quality Monitoring
**Duration:** 2 minutes  
**Goal:** Verify packet statistics

Check the Data Quality panel:
1. Packets Received: Should increase continuously
2. Packets Lost: Should stay at 0 (simulator is perfect)
3. Packet Loss: Should show 0.0%
4. Last Packet: Updates every ~0.5s
5. Connection: Green dot (‚óè)

---

### Test Scenario 4: Pre-Flight Checklist
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Goal:** Test system readiness check

1. Go to "Pre-Flight" tab
2. Initially: Red "NOT READY" status
3. Check each item one by one:
   - GPS Lock Acquired
   - All Sensors Calibrated
   - Battery > 80%
   - Storage Space Available
   - Ground Station Connected
   - Parachute System Armed
4. Verify status turns green: "READY FOR LAUNCH"

---

### Test Scenario 5: Mission Statistics
**Duration:** 3 minutes  
**Goal:** Verify statistical tracking

Monitor Mission Statistics panel:

**During Flight:**
- Max Altitude should increase during ascent
- Max Altitude should NOT change during descent (it's the max!)
- Max Speed captures highest velocity
- Flight Time increases continuously
- Current Altitude updates in real-time

**At End of Flight:**
- Max Altitude: ~1000m
- Max Speed: ~8 m/s
- Flight Time: ~250 seconds
- Current Altitude: 0m

## üéØ Competition-Ready Tests

### Judge Presentation Test
**What Judges Want to See:**

1. **Clear Visual Indicators**
   - Show the mission phase indicator
   - Point out the color coding (green=good, red=critical)

2. **Data Quality Proof**
   - Show packet statistics (proves reliable telemetry)
   - Show connection status (green dot)

3. **Key Metrics**
   - Max altitude achieved
   - Flight duration
   - Successful parachute deployment

4. **Data Logging**
   - Show that data was recorded throughout flight
   - Export CSV as proof
   - Show analysis capabilities

**Practice Script:**
```
"Our ground station GUI shows real-time telemetry with mission phase 
tracking. As you can see, we successfully reached [X] meters altitude 
and our parachute deployed at [Y] seconds. We achieved a packet loss 
rate of [Z]%, demonstrating reliable communications. All data was 
logged and is available for detailed analysis."
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: GUI doesn't start
**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'`

**Fix:**
```bash
pip install PyQt5 pyqtgraph numpy pandas
```

---

### Issue 2: Blank graphs
**Problem:** Graphs show but no data appears

**Fix:**
- Wait 1-2 seconds for data to accumulate
- Check console for error messages
- Verify simulator is running (print statements)

---

### Issue 3: Mission timer not updating
**Problem:** LCD display shows 0.00

**Fix:**
- Click "Start Mission" button first
- This initializes the mission timer

---

### Issue 4: Alerts panel empty
**Problem:** No alerts appear

**Fix:**
- Alerts only appear during specific events
- Try clicking "Start Mission" (triggers INFO alert)
- Wait for altitude > 900m (triggers WARNING alert)

## üöÄ Advanced Testing

### Add Packet Loss Simulation
Want to test with realistic packet loss?

Add this to `flight_simulator.py`:

```python
def getData(self):
    # Simulate 5% packet loss
    if random.random() < 0.05:
        return None  # Lost packet
    
    return self.simulator.update(dt * 2)
```

Then in the GUI's `update_data()`:
```python
if data is None:  # Lost packet
    self.packets_lost += 1
    return
```

---

### Test with Real Serial Data (When Available)
When you have real hardware:

1. Comment out the simulator in `cansat_gui_enhanced.py`
2. Replace with real serial code:

```python
import serial

class Communication:
    def __init__(self, port='COM3', baudrate=9600):
        self.ser = serial.Serial(port, baudrate)
    
    def getData(self):
        if self.ser.in_waiting:
            line = self.ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
            # Parse your telemetry format
            return parse_telemetry(line)
```
